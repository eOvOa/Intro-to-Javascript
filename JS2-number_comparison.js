// Create a conditional statement that compares two numbers.
// You can choose if those numbers will be equal, less than, greater than,
// less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to each other.
// Include an if, else if, and else statement. 
// Create an alert that gives your user feedback based on the number
// Test your statement with different numbers to make sure all alerts work.

// define two numbers 
let num1 = 1;
let num2 = 8;

// compare two strings and generate alert
if (num1 > num2) {
  alert("num1 is greater than num2");
} else if (num1 < num2) {
  alert("num1 is less than num2");
} else {
  alert("num1 and num2 are equal");
