// Create a conditional statement that checks if two strings are equal.
// Include an if and else statement.
// Create an alert that gives your user feedback based on the string defined.
// Test your statement with different strings to make sure both alerts work.

// define two strings
let string1 = "Hi! I'm Eva";
let string2 = "Hello! My name is Eva";

// compare two strings and generate alert
if (string1 === string2) {
